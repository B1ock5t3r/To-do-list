# To-do-list
This program allows the user to create a list of things they want to do. After this list is created they can add more tasks, view tasks, mark a task as completed, remove a task, and exit the list. The second part of the program allows the user to remove all tasks from the list, sort the list alphabetically, and print the number of items.
