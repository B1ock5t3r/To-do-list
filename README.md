# To-do-list
This program allows the user to create a list of things they want to do. After this list is created they can add more tasks, view tasks, mark a task as completed, remove a task, and exit the list. The second part of the program allows the user to remove all tasks from the list, sort the list alphabetically, and print the number of items. Initially I had issues with a different set of coding in relation to being able to execute this three functions. However since these three functions are fairly simple I was able to make a more simple program to showcase them.
